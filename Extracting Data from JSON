# Extracting Data from JSON

# In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to
# http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/json2.py. The program will prompt for a URL,
# read the JSON data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract
# the comment counts from the JSON data, compute the sum of the numbers in
# the file and enter the sum below:

# We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we
# give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need
# to process for the assignment.

# Sample data: http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json (Sum=2553)
# Actual data: http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_245084.json (Sum ends with 9)

# You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will
# read the data directly from the URL. Note: Each student will have a distinct
# data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.

# Data Format
# The data consists of a number of names and comment counts in JSON as follows:
# {
#   comments: [
#     {
#       name: "Matthias"
#       count: 97
#     },
#     {
#       name: "Geomer"
#       count: 97
#     }
#     ...
#   ]
# }

# Sample Execution

# $ python solution.py
# Enter location: http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json
# Retrieving http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json
# Retrieved 2733 characters
# Count: 50
# Sum: 2482

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# My code:

# Import libraries to access web data
import urllib                          # urllib = to fetch data from world-wide web.
import json                            # To parse through obtained JSON script later

count = [] 
url = raw_input('Enter location: ')

print 'Retrieving', url
connection = urllib.urlopen(url)	   # Where it is JSON URL
data = connection.read()
print 'Retrieved',len(data),'characters'

parsed_data = json.loads(data)
js = parsed_data["comments"]           # Makes it easier to reference block in files
	
for item in js:
    count.append(item['count'])

print "Count: {0}".format(len(count))
print "Sum: {0}".format(sum(count))
