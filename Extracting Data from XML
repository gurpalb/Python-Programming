# Extracting Data from XML

# In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/geoxml.py. 
# The program will prompt for a URL, read the XML data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the XML data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file.

# We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

# Sample data: http://pr4e.dr-chuck.com/tsugi/mod/python-data/data/comments_42.xml (Sum=2553) 
# Actual data:  Actual data: http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_245080.xml (Sum ends with 5) 
# You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL. 
# Note: Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis. 

# Enter location: http://pr4e.dr-chuck.com/tsugi/mod/python-data/data/comments_42.xml 
# Retrieving http://pr4e.dr-chuck.com/tsugi/mod/python-data/data/comments_42.xml 
# Retrieved 4210 characters 
# Count: 50 
# Sum: 2553

# Note: the links appear with information in a tree format which have:
# -<commentinfo>
#     <note>This file contains the sample data for testing</note>
#    -<comments>
#        <comment>
#           <name>Romina</name>
#           <count>97</count>
#        </comment>
# ...

# My code is below:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Import libraries to access web data
import urllib                          # urllib = to fetch data from world-wide web.
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET     # ET is just a name that can be used later in code, 
                                       # ElementTree represents the whole XML document as a tree, and Element represents a single node in this tree.
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup          # Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.

count = 0 
url = raw_input('Enter location: ')

print 'Retrieving', url
frame = urllib.urlopen(url)
data = frame.read()
print 'Retrieved',len(data),'characters'
    # print data
tree = ET.fromstring(data)             # Built-in parsing (i.e. de-serialization) to get object tree, which is now an internal object

lst = tree.findall('.//comment')       # Find tag name in object, which is where I want to pull out numbers inbetween <count>number</count>
for item in lst:
    count = count + int(item.find('count').text)
print "Sum:", count                    # Count is sum at this point
